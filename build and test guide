📚 Overview:

This guide will help beginners and intermediate developers build and run contracts with ease.

⚒️ Building a contract

🖥️ 1. Install Dependecies:
scarb 
Universal-Sierra-compiler 
Rust >=1.80.1 

You can install Scarb via:
asdf 
Snfoundryup 
Windows 
Source code.

2. ✅ Once you're done, verify that scarb is installed correctly.

3. 🏃 To start a new project, run 'snforge init'

4.📑 To enable Starknet contract compilation, write this line in Scarb.toml 
[[target.starknet-contract]]

5. 👉 Declare a dependency on Starknet package with "[dependencies starknet = "2.8.5"


🧪 Testing:

1. ✅  The 'scarb test' command tests any local package.

2. ✅  'scarb cairo-test' automatically enables Starknet-related testing features.

3. 🏃 To use Starknet Foundry as the test runner, run 
[scripts] test = "snforge test"

4. 🚀 For custom and multiple tests, define the script and add the additional test.

5. 🌟 Don't forget to give us a star!
