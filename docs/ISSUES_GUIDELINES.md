## 🚀 General Process

1. **Check Existing Issues**

    - Before creating a new issue, check if the problem or feature is already reported.
    - If an issue exists, comment on it instead of creating a duplicate.

2. **Requesting an Issue to Work On**

    - If you find one you’d like to work on:
        - Comment: Please include a detailed comment covering the following points:
            - **Introduce Yourself:** Share your background and relevant experience.
            - **Proposed Solution:** Briefly outline your approach to solving the issue. It doesn’t need to be overly detailed, just enough to convey your plan.
            - **Why You’re a Good Fit:** Highlight any skills or past experiences that make you the ideal candidate to tackle this issue.
            - **Additional Insights:** Add anything else you believe will make your application for the issue stand out.

    - Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you before starting.

## 🖊️ Creating a New Issue

1. **Use a Descriptive Title**

    - Summarize the problem or feature in one sentence.

    **Examples:**
    - `Bug: Login button does not respond when clicked`
    - `Feature: Add dark mode toggle`

2. **Follow the Issue Template**

    - If the repository has an issue template, fill it out completely.  
**Include:**

    - **Steps to Reproduce** (for bugs).
    - **Expected Behavior** and **Actual Behavior**.
    - Screenshots, logs, or relevant error messages.
    - A clear **Description** of your request for features or enhancements.

3. **Be Specific and Clear**

    - Avoid vague descriptions. Provide enough context for others to understand and reproduce the issue.

## 🔄 Issue Workflow

1. **Triaging**

    - Maintainers review and validate new issues.
    - Labels, priorities, and assignees are added.

2. Work Assignment

    - If you want to take up an issue, comment on it and wait for the assignment.
    - Assigned contributors should update the issue regularly with progress.

3. Resolving the Issue

    - Once the work is complete, link your PR to the issue using keywords like `Closes #<issue_number>` in the PR description.
    - The issue will close automatically when the PR is merged.

## 💡 Best Practices

- **Be Respectful:** Keep communication professional and kind.
- **Ask Questions:** If something is unclear, don’t hesitate to ask in the comments.
- **Keep it Focused:** Stick to the scope of the issue. For unrelated points, open a new issue.
- **Use Screenshots or Logs:** Visual aids and error messages make debugging easier.
